We, at the newly established division for Computational Radiology & Clinical AI at the University Hospital Bonn / University of Bonn (PI: Philipp Vollmuth – Full Professor of AI in Medical Imaging) are looking for applications for multiple PhD positions at the intersection of AI and Radiology. Our research group has consistently contributed to premier journals and conferences, including The Lancet Oncology, The Lancet Digital Health, Nature Communications, Radiology, MICCAI1,2. You can also check out our work on our GitHub page3 and an online demonstrator for some of our developed algorithms4. This is a great opportunity to dive into AI-driven translational research and contribute to significant advancements in the clinical application of Computer Vision or NLP algorithms. 

## Your Responsibilities

- Conduct state-of-the-art AI research with large-scale medical images, reports and clinical data 
- Work closely with clinicians to translate research work into clinical practices 
- Publish your work on national and international conferences and journals 

## Your Qualifications

- MSc in computer science, mathematics, physics, statistics, or a related field 
- Theoretical and practical experience in deep learning, and machine learning 
- Interest in clinical data and working with interdisciplinary teams 
- Team player with passion to work in an intercultural environment 
- High degree of autonomy and excellent problem-solving skills

## Your Benefits

- 100% of TVL E-13 with 3 years 
- Access to large-scale multicentric datasets (>100,000 neuroradiological MR and CT scans, large cohort of text reports etc.) 
- The division has exclusive access to the latest and powerful computing resource (NVIDIA DGX H100 cluster). Each group member is provided with powerful personal workstations (with RTX A6000 GPUs, etc.). 
- Access to the latest medical imaging scanners (multiple of the latest 3T MR scanners, a 0.065T Swoop hyperfine scanner5 and a 7T MR scanner) 
- Opportunities to collaborate with other research groups and institutes, such as DKFZ (German Cancer Research Center), DZNE (German research center for Neurodegenerative Diseases), Mathematics Department at the University of Bonn, within EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) and within MICCAI BRATS.  
- Opportunities to attend national and international conferences (MICCAI, CVPR,...) 
- Potential for being involved in industry (research) collaborations 

## Interested? Contact us

- Please send your application to contact@ccibonn.ai including your CV and a short cover letter (~ 1 page, about yourself (not included in CV) and your research interest)
