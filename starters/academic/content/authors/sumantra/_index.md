I'm a Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience in building scalable back-end systems and distributed cloud solutions. Before joining CCIBonn.ai, I had short stints at Meta and Amazon AWS, where I helped improve large-scale infrastructure for products like Facebook, Instagram, and AWS IoT. Earlier in my career, I also worked at the Biorobotics Lab at the National University of Singapore, where I developed real-time control systems for robotics using C/C++, Python, Django, and AWS. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo and specialize in Java, Python, Spring Boot, and AWS.
