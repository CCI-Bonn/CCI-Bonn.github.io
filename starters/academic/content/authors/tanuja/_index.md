I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Neuroradiology and the Division of Computational Radiology and Clinical AI at the Universitätsklinikum Bonn. I have done my M.Tech from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and B.E from Gujarat Technological University in Biomedical Engineering. After that, I was a Researcher in TCS Research and Innovation for 2 years where I worked on advancing EEG data analysis. My research interests lie in innovating medical imaging techniques and neurodegenerative diseases. I also enjoy exploring new dance forms and places.
