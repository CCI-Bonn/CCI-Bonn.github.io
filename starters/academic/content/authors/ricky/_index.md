I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Neuroradiology of Universitätsklinikum Bonn, working on the application of foundation models to the medical domain, particularly medical imaging. I am particularly interested in multimodal fusion problems with missing modalities, domain shift problems, and creating robust tools to aid clinicians and to help improve patient outcomes.

My PhD research at the Empenn team in Inria/Irisa Rennes was focused on automated segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions in spinal cord MRI. In particular, I studied techniques for fusing information from multiple MRI sequences, especially when some sequences are missing for some subjects. During my PhD, I also spent time as a visiting researcher at Boston Children's Hospital & Harvard Medical School for several months, working with Simon Warfield, Davood Karimi, and Prabhjot Kaur. Previously, I completed a six-month research internship at Hera-MI, a French startup specialising in automated detection of breast cancer in mammography. Before my master's degree, I worked for four years as a data analyst at Glanbia PLC.
