I aspire to work at the forefront of oncologic MRI, and as a radiologist and medical physicist at the research-clinical interface to advocate for an expedited translation of pivotal innovations such as Deep Learning into the clinic. I am committed to a diverse and inclusive radiological society worldwide that takes full advantage of its interdisciplinary talent pool.
