I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Neuroradiology, Universitätsklinikum Bonn, Germany, where I work on developing novel deep learning strategies for improving clinical throughput. I hold a master's degree in Physics from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, and a bachelor's degree in Physics from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Prior to joining my PhD, I have worked for 3 years at Vijna Labs, Bangalore, on developing deep learning algorithms in computer vision with applications in banking and finance.

Outside of academia, I play badminton and enjoy motorcycle riding.
